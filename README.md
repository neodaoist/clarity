Clarity is a **decentralized counterparty clearinghouse (DCP)**, for the writing, transfer, and settlement of options and futures contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The protocol is open source, open state, and open access. It has zero oracles, zero governance, and zero custody. It is designed to be secure, composable, immutable, ergonomic, and gas minimal.
